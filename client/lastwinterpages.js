I.

In her heyday, my grandmother was a seamstress for Oscar De La Renta. I stop by her house on my way to school to remind her that it’s her ninety-fifth birthday. “Everybody’s dead,” she says.


Since her husband passed, she’s marked every calendar occasion by announcing, “I won’t be here next year, I tell you that.” After ten years, it’s still her catchphrase, but she’s added another – “I’m too ornery to even die.” Sometimes I catch myself laughing at it too loudly.


Professionally, she was some sort of freelance specialist. Mr. De La Renta would give her a sketch, and she’d look at how fancy it was and give him a price which, she says, he never once argued. “I worked for two or three places, but the gowns – I used to like that. I liked everything that was rich looking, y’know?”


I dig for gossip on her designer bosses, but she mostly wants to talk about money. Her daughters, she complains, have all these degrees and no money. In her old age, she supports them – just as in her youth, she supported her parents. “I used to feel so sorry for my father. He worked on the railroad for so long, y’know? He would come in with his salary, and sometimes what he made every week, I made in two days.”


“I tell you one thing,” she says. “Everybody used to say become a secretary and all that. I says to myself no… They never would have made the money I made. God bless my mother and father, I took care of them, bought their house. And this here house, I paid cash. I was the only one in the whole neighborhood.”


I’m staring at my iPhone. In five minutes, I’ll leave to catch my train. I have class at night and a paper to write. “I wanted so much to go to college,” she’s saying, “but I had to go to work. It was during depression time.”


Her front door is open, letting some light in. “Is it cold out?” she asks.


It’s pretty cold, I say.


“It is? I’m looking at those clouds. Look at those clouds.” She has me get up and kneel next to her. “Here, this way… Don’t they look lovely? It’s like a ceiling, one after another. What is it?”


Through her screen door, it looks like a cotton-ball blanket drawing over the neighborhood. I have to squint, the clouds are so bright on top, but dark as shadows underneath. “Almost looks like snow,” she says.


The light is hurting my eyes.


“Is it cold out?”
